Import an image from Unsplash, Pexels or Pixabay and format it for your Roam Research graph.

**New:**
- import from Pixabay. You will need an API key from https://pixabay.com/api/docs/
- mode (random vs prompt) settings are now available for each of Unsplash, Pexels and Pixabay, rather than being shared

Configuration Options:
- All:
  - embed a random image or prompt for the search term you wish to use
  
- Unsplash:
  - width
  - display format
  
- Pexels:
  - display format
  
- Pixabay:
  - orientation
  - safe search mode
  - Editor's Choice awardees
  - language code for search term

You will need to create a developer account at https://unsplash.com/developers. Then, create an Application using the demo type, with Public access permissions.
Finally, obtain your Access Key to enter in the settings in Roam Depot.
